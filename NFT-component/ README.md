### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to keep the footer in place.
 ```
#footer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2.5rem;
```





### Continued development

For future projects, I would to improve on creating containers with the <div> tags and learn about Flexbox in more detail.



### Useful resources

- [How To Create an Overlay Image Icon](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay_icon.asp) - This helped me create the hover effect. I love this pattern and will definitely use it again in the future. 
- [How To-Cards](https:https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_product_card.asp) - This article helped me finally understand how to create a card container. I'd recommend it to anyone struggle to create this component.
